# Data

This directory contains the data used in the project. Due to their size and sensitive nature, raw and processed data files are not committed directly to the Git repository. They are listed in the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental uploads.

## Adding New Data

If you add new data folders or large files to this directory, please ensure you update the `.gitignore` file accordingly to prevent them from being tracked by Git. This helps keep the repository clean and manageable.
